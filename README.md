# fifa_data_visualisation

Above is the notebook containing data cleaning and pre-processing work done to the fifa 2019 dataset.

It also includes further visualisations of various common statistics along with in-depth visualisation of a few niche topics based on the player information extracted. 

If the file isn't available to be previewed, I have provided the dataset used.

To view the file in its full, I'd suggest downloading the fifa-data-visualization.ipynb file along with data.csv and running all cells in the notebook.
